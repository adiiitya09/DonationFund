                  <p>Undoubtedly, there could be thousands of such organizations but you should be able to find <br> the right and authentic organization so as to ensure that the money that goes for donation reaches <br> to the poor and the needy ones.</p> <br>
                 
                  It is time to be a little responsible and grateful because without responsibility you can change the world. <br> You might go on talking about change and helping the poor but the words are not the things. <br> In fact, if you really want to help then you should donate money to the poor. <br> <br>

                  We are just creating a public awareness to help needy and poor peoples because one people will starting <br> to help then slowly there will by thousands of people can join us to help needy and poor people. <br> We can make this world more happier together.
